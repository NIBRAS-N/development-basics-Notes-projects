# Core Concept

## Angular Architecture:
  - Components
  - Modules
  - Services
  - Directives
  - Pipes
## Data Binding
  - Interpolation
  - Property Binding
  - Event Binding
  - Two-way Binding
## Component Interaction
  - Input and Output Decorators
  - Event Emitter
  - ViewChild and ContentChild
## Angular CLI
  - Common Commands (generate, build, serve, test)
  - Configuration (angular.json)

# Advanced Topics:

## Routing
  - Router Module
  - Routes and Paths
  - Route Guards
  - Lazy Loading
  - Route Resolvers

## Dependency Injection

  - Injectable Decorator
  - Providers
  - Injection Tokens
  - Hierarchical Injector

## Forms

  - Template-driven Forms
  - Reactive Forms
  - Form Validation (built-in and custom validators)
  - FormBuilder

## Change Detection

  - Change Detection Strategy
  - Zones
  - Async Pipe

## Performance Optimization

  - Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation
  - Lazy Loading Modules
  - OnPush Change Detection Strategy
  - Angular Universal (Server-side Rendering)
  - Service Workers for PWA

# Testing

## Unit Testing
    - Jasmine and Karma
    - Testing Components, Services, and Pipes
## End-to-End Testing
    - Protractor
    - Writing and Running E2E Tests
    
# State Management

## RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript)

  - Observables and Subjects  
  - Operators (map, filter, mergeMap, switchMap)
  - Async/Await with Observables

# HTTP Client
  - HttpClient Module
  - Interceptors
  - Handling HTTP Requests and Responses
  - Error Handling
