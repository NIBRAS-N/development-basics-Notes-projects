### What is Software? Types of Software’s?

- Software refers to a collection of instructions, programs, data, and documentation that perform specific tasks on a computer or electronic device.
- #### `Types of SW`:
  - `System Software:`
    - Operating Systems :  Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
      
    - Device Drivers: Software that enables communication between hardware devices and the operating system.
      
    - Utility Programs: Tools that perform maintenance, optimization, and troubleshooting tasks, such as antivirus software, disk defragmenters, and backup utilities.
   
    - Servers

  - `Application Software`:
 
    - Application software refers to programs designed to perform specific tasks or functions for end-users.
   
    - EG: `web app , mobile app , desktop app`
   
  - `Programming SW`:
      - **Compilers**:
          - Compilers are software tools that translate high-level programming languages (such as C, C++, Java) into machine code or intermediate code that can be executed by a computer's processor.
          - They analyze the entire source code of a program and generate an executable file or another form of output (such as bytecode for Java).
      - **debuggers**
          - Debuggers are software tools used by developers to identify and resolve errors, bugs, and other issues in a program.
      - **Interpeters**
          - Interpreters are software tools that execute high-level programming languages directly, without the need for prior compilation into machine code.
          - They read and interpret source code line by line and execute it sequentially.

### What is Software Testing?

  - Software testing is a process of evaluating a software application or system to ensure that it meets specified requirements and functions correctly.

### What is SW quality?

  - Software quality refers to the degree to which a software product or system meets specified requirements and user expectations.
  - bug free
  - delivered on time
  - within budget
  - meets requirements or expectations
  - maintainable

###  Project Vs Product:

  - if software application is developed for a specific customer based on the requirement then it is called project.
  - if software application is developed for multiple customers based on market requirements then it is called product.

### Why do we need testing?

  - ensure the software is bug free
  - ensure the system meets customer requirements and software specification
  - ensure that system meets end user expectations

### ERROR : 
  - any incorrect human action that produces a problem in the system is called an error
### Defect/BUG:
  - deviation from the expected behavior to the actual behavior of the system is called defect
### Failure:
  - the deviation  identified by end user while using the system is called failure
    
### Why software have bug?

  - Miscommunication or no communication
  - Software complexity
  - Programming errors
  - Changing requirements

# Part-2:

### SDLC:
  - software development life cycle is a process used by software industry to design development test softwares

### WaterFall Model:

  - The Waterfall model is a linear sequential software development lifecycle model that follows a strict step-by-step approach.

### Spiral model:

### Testing:

  - `Static Testing:`
      - Analysis of a program carried out without executing the program.
      - Done during verification process i.e before development
      - code is not testd in this phrase, only documentation is tested.
      - Process:
          - Walkthrough
          - Insepction
          - Informal review Unplaned and undcoument
          - Technical Review , fault process
  - `Dynamic Testing`:
      - **Black Box Tesing (Functinal Testing)**
          - System Testing
              - in this testing we can test whole application (complete / integrated software is tested)
              - done by tester
          - UAT Testing
              - a level of software Testing in which software is tested for user acceptance
              - UAT done at client location where software is actually used
              - <i>Alpha Testing :</i> done by tester in company in presence of customer
              - <i>Beta Testing :</i> done by customer to check software is ok , satisfy requirement
              - 
      - **White Box Testing (Non Functional ):**
        
          - <i>Unit Testing</i>
            - in unit testing individual component of software tested.
            - (done by developer by using sample input and observing its sample output)
              
          - <i>Integration Teting</i> 
              - in integration Testing individual units are combined and tested as group (developer)
              - (i) Top-down
              - (ii) Bottom-up
              - (iii) Sandwich
              - (iv) Big-Bang
           
    - **Functional testing:**
          - Check a piece of software is acting in accordance with pre-determined requirements.
          - is a type of black-box testing.
      
    - **Non Functional Testing :**
          - checking how many people can simultaneously check out of a shopping basket
          • Load testing
          • Reliability
          • The readiness of a system
          • Usability testing

    - **Smoke testing :**
        - (Testing on newly released build → compulsary requirement )
        - It is first testing on newly released build

    - **Sanity Testing :**
        - ( Testing on newly released build → check Compulsory + optional )
